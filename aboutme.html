       <h1>About Me</h1>
       <p>Currently studying In Naples High School, I was born in Cuba but in 2020 I moved to United State to have a better life. I've always had high scores, but in my eighth grade I regrettably failed two classes. Nonetheless, I intend to work extremely hard this year to be able to pass them on.
 I have always placed too much emphasis on education and neglected myself, I truly want to focus more on myself. In my personal life, I'd like to participate in a sport or activity that I really enjoy. On the other side, I would like to finish high school and be able to attend the university to earn a psychology degree As I enjoy learning about how human psychology functions, I believe that this line of employment is a great fit for me.=I've been working hard at school to finish most of my assignments early so that I may spend more time with my best friend. As a result, occasionally I go running and shopping with her. Yet I also put in a lot of effort in the classroom to achieve decent grades. Also, I believe that I need to improve my communication skills because I have always been an introverted person and I know how bad this is for my professional life.
 I also need to learn how to collaborate with others because I've always worked alone, and I know that won't always be the case in my line of work. My other minor objectives include honing my photography and editing abilities as well as my English language proficiency. I also want to develop my cooking and swimming skills. I want to go to Cuba to visit my family and I want to take online classes to enhance my credentials. I want to be recognized for my calm, sincere, and friendly personality attributes as well as for my academic dedication and university graduation. In addition, I want everyone to recognize my reliability. To find out more about me you can visit my Instagram: @eri_ka71308.</p>
